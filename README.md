# LATCH
Implementation of LATCH descriptor (Levi/Hassner)

This is my own implementation of the LATCH descriptor by Levi and Hassner written from scratch in C++.

The LATCH paper is [here.](https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/LATCH/LATCH.pdf)

I used the LATCH triple values from the OpenCV implementation [source code.(https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/xfeatures2d/src/latch.cpp)
